# House Price Prediction

**House Price Prediction** is a web application built with Flask that estimates house prices based on key features such as the area of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the age of the house. It employs Multivariate Regression to make accurate price predictions. The project uses dummy house price data in CSV format.

## Introduction
